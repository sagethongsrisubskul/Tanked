## How to Play
One player will host the game, while the others will join the host by entering the host's IP address. (Up to 4 players including the host.)

After the host has selected a map, and all players have selected their teams, the host starts the game to begin the match.

### Dealthmatch Mode
Players fire at each other and use various powerups to destroy tanks on other teams until only one team remains. Last team remianing wins.

### Highscore Mode
Players play a timed match. The team with the highest score at the end wins! Times available are 1, 5, 15, 20, and 30 minutes. Players' health is not decreased in this mode so no dying. Score is calculated as follows: 

- 1 point for every 1 point of damage you inflict
- -1 point for every 1 point of damage you inccur
- 500 points for every powerup you collect
- -250 points for every powerup you activate

### Controls
- W, S: Move the tank forwards or backwards
- A, D: Rotate the tank left or right
- Mouse: Aim the tank's turret
- Left Mouse Button: Fire turret

If the player has any powerups in their inventory, the player can activate by clicking on the powerup icon on the top of the screen, or by the following keyboard key:
- 1: Use health pack. (Restores some health)
- 2: Place down mine. (Directly below tank.)
- 3: Use speed boost pack. (Wears off over time.)
- 4: Use armor boost pack. (Wears off over time.)
- 5: Use invincibility pack. (Wears off over time.)
- 6: Use beer. (Wears off over time, afterwards player experiences "hangover" which negatively effects armor and speed.)

### Powerups
6 Powerup items are availble:
- Health pack: Recovers a portion of player's health
- Mines: Damages enemy tanks when they drive over.
- Speed boost pack: Temporarily increase tank's speed.
- Armor boost pack: Temporarily increase tank's defense.
- Invincibility pack: No damage taken for a period of time.
